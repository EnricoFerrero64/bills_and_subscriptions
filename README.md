# Bills & Subscriptions

A [Wealthfolio](https://wealthfolio.app) addon that tracks your recurring subscriptions and bills so you can see exactly where your money goes each month.

## Features

- **Subscriptions tab** — add, edit, pause, or delete recurring services (Netflix, Spotify, etc.); set a start date to track full billing history
- **Bills tab** — track irregular bills (electricity, water, rent) grouped by month; mark them paid with one click; recurring bills auto-generate the next occurrence when marked paid
- **Summary tab** — combined monthly/yearly spend card, category breakdowns with progress bars, and a 6-month bill history chart with cumulative line
- **Wealthfolio Sync** — optionally push all subscription and bill charges to any Wealthfolio cash account as withdrawal transactions; fully idempotent, safe to run multiple times
- **Multi-currency** — 20 supported currencies, shown separately (no forced conversion)
- **Favicon logos** — enter a website URL and the addon fetches the service's icon automatically
- **Offline-first** — all data lives in `localStorage`; no server, no account required

## Requirements

- [Wealthfolio](https://wealthfolio.app) desktop app (Windows / macOS)
